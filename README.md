## GENESIS (GNS) | DIGITAL MONETARY BASE

Genesis (GNS) is the foundational Store of Value token designed to serve as the immutable, transparent monetary base for the next generation of decentralized finance. Built with a pure ERC-20 contract, GNS adheres strictly to the philosophy: "In Code We Trust."

### CORE PRINCIPLES

* Financial Sovereignty: Restoring full financial control to the individual user ("Be Your Own Bank").
* Immutability: The token contract is deployed with a fixed supply, ensuring no arbitrary inflation is possible.
* Trust Layer: Simplicity in the contract code serves as the ultimate guarantee of security and predictability.

### TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

* **Token Symbol:** GNS
* **Token Name:** GENESIS
* **Contract Standard:** Pure ERC-20 (Solidity 0.8.20+)
* **Max Supply:** 1,000,000,000 GNS (1 Billion)
* **Compatibility:** 100% compatible (Zero fees, multi-chain EVM-ready)
* **Contract Base:** Auditado OpenZeppelin Libraries

### SECURITY AND TOKENOMICS

The Genesis token uses simplicity as its primary security feature:

* Fixed Supply: The entire 1 Billion GNS supply is minted only once in the constructor. The absence of a custom mint() function guarantees that the total supply can never be increased, simulating digital scarcity.
* Zero Tax Policy: No transaction fees are implemented at the protocol level. This ensures clean transfers and low friction for transfers, reinforcing its role as a Store of Value.
* Vesting Commitment: Team and development allocations are locked in transparent Vesting Contracts to ensure long-term commitment.
* Code Transparency: The simple, pure ERC-20 code minimizes the attack surface, simplifying external security audits.

### LAUNCH & DEVELOPMENT

The Genesis token is implemented across EVM-compatible chains, starting on Polygon.
